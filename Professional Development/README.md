# Professional Development Plan

This is my ever-changing plan for my own professional development (PD). I started my career as a consultant where PD was a natural and necessary part of job but as I moved to the product landscape and had changing responsibilities outside of work I found that maintaining the momentum was difficult. As such, I decided that documenting my plan for my own PD would only help me with consistently growing.

## Read

I want to push myself to read more articles (blog posts, whitepapers, etc). I want to broaden my FOV of the tech landscape to gain a better understanding of how things fit together.

- **30 minutes daily:** Read articles from my RSS feed or the [[Articles|article list]].
- **Weekly:** Spend a few minutes (timeboxed) on the following sources checking out candidates to be added to my RSS feed: Reddit, Google, Golang Weekly, etc checking out candidates to be added to my RSS feed.

## Write

I want to help others by putting my learnings out in the open because it was only through reading others' learnings that I was able to get to where I am today. I also believe that it will help me grow as an engineer, teacher, and communicator.

- **After reading an article:** Decide whether I would read it again or recommend others read it. If so, add its link to the weekly log along with a few bullet points if needed.
- **Weekly:** Finalise the weekly log by adding the following:
	- Technical concepts explored
    - Code patterns or techniques learned
    - Questions that arose during the week
    - Goals for next week
- **Occasionally:** Write a blog or note post.
	- A blog post is about my learnings or area of expertise which I would like to share.
	- A note post is an opportunity to build upon someone else's article which I found exceptionally valuable. I share a summary, key insights, and my personal takeaways.

## Create

**Often:** Continue creating personal projects based off of a passion or interest. Don't force personal projects. Reading provides a platform for exploring new concepts, writing is a way of easily filtering out topics that are not of interest to me, and projects are an opportunity to dive deeper into the things that excite me. I expect these projects to be a good indication of type of technical work I would enjoy next in my career.
