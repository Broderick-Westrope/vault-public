# Public Vault

This repository is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault containing artefacts I'd like to make public with the world. I enjoy creating things and believe that creating in the open is helpful for all; I gain the opportunity to get feedback and others gain the ability to learn from what would otherwise be only seen by me. If you have any feedback or advice regarding a project idea, technical misunderstanding, my writing, or anything else I'd be happy to hear it. I'm simply looking to grow.

*NOTE: This repo is currently quite new. I'm exploring ways to structure it better. If you have ideas on this I'd love to hear :)*
