# Articles

The following are articles/collections I *HAVE NOT* yet read/explored. Once read, if I consider an article worth reading again, or would recommend someone else read it, it will be added to that weeks weekly log and potentially have its own note post. See my [[Tech/Professional Development/README|Professional Development Plan]] for more information.
