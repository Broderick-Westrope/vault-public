# Frontend Routes

- **/auth**
	- **/send**: Get user email/phone and send OTP.
	- **/verify**: Prompt user for OTP code and verify it. `phone`/`email` query param is provided to display where the code was sent.
- **/events**: List users' invited events. `shortcut` query param is used by shortcut links (eg. upcoming, archive, organising, pending invites) to filter the list (*should this instead be using normal filters and computed in the caller?*). Other "standard" query params exist for further/custom filtering.
	- **/public**: A list of public events. This can be viewed without authentication. I would like to automatically locate the user to present an area-specific list by default. Certain filters/properties are not relevant when unauthenticated (eg. invite status).
	- **/:id**: View details of the event.
		- **/edit**: Edit/update the event details.
		- **/attendees**: View a list of people attending the event. *Maybe there should be an account feature to only show your profile to select groups; public, private, level 1 mutual connections*.
	- **/create**: Form to create a new event
- **/account**: View the logged in user details.
	- **/edit**: Edit the details of the currently logged in user.
- **/connections**: View the users list of connections
