# Infrastructure Planning
- FE, domain API, and auth API to be hosted using Azure Web App instances.
	- This deploys as docker containers
- Azure VM
	- This will be used to manually setup Postgres (and expose the port).
- Azure Virtual Network (VNET) to secure & connect resources.
- Azure Application Gateway to unify the endpoints for the auth and domain API.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
	- Need to build each project into a container before deploying.
